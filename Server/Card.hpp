/*
 * Card Class
 *
 * -David Browning, Ligia Frangello & Katie Sweet
 *
 * The purpose of this file is to allow others to build a card object.
 * Cards contain a suit and a value.
 * Suit is an enum {HEARTS}
 *
 * The constuctor accepts the suit enum and one integer.
 *
 * The suit enum (HEARTS, SPADES, CLUBS, DIAMONDS, UNDEFINED) determines the
 * suit. The reason for the UNDEFINED suit type is that in the Player Class,
 * there is a function called requestMove() that returns a vector of Cards.
 * In the game Crazy Eight's, a move can consist of drawing a card from the
 * deck. We need an UNDEFINED type to alert the Crazy Eight's game logic that
 * they chose the draw pile instead of playing a card.
 *
 * The integer (2-14) determines the value. We have established Ace to be 14
 * instead of 1. This makes sorting easier since Ace is high in our Hearts and
 * Spades.
